The Power Quality Instrumentation manufactured by Dranetz divides into two main ranges:

- Handheld Portables
- Low Cost Energy Loggers - the new DranXpert.

Dranetz has class leading developments addressing each of these market segments.The HDPQ can be seen in detail by visiting their website. Nowadays there is considerable crossover between the Portable and Permanently installed systems. IMH can show the HDPQ series working with the Multi-Mobile Data source SIM that will communicate via the strongest mobile signal found - either O2, Vodaphone, EE etc. Many hours can be saved by remotely checking, correcting setups and downloading the stored data without the need to visit site. Crucially the Dranview Software has a built in report writer to give Pass/Fail on a G5/5 harmonics analysis.
